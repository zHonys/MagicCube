# MagicCube

MagicCube is a repository that simulates in 3D space the toy with same name (or "rubik's cube" in some countries)

## commands

Move the camera with the mouse

to turn and rotate the cube, there are commands with the given letters:

R, U, L, D, F, B to turn it, and X, Y, Z to rotate arround given axis

All of them map to the movemente of same letter (e.g. U being the "Up" turn, L being the "Left" turn, X being rotate the whole cube arround the X axis)

These movements were made by the cubing community and can be seen here: https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation

holding shift makes the turn/rotation do their reverse form, for exemple:

shift + R = 'R
